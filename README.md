## Usage

To start the dev server, click "Run" or execute `npm run dev` in the Shell. You'll see a Webview pane with the app.

Enter an SSID, password, and encryption method to generate a QR Code and download it.

## How does it work?

This is a React app written in JavaScript. It uses the [shadcn/ui](ui.shadcn.com), which is a component library built on Tailwind CSS.

`App.jsx` holds the logic for the application, including state management variables and event handlers. 

The app uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a development framework to make the build + deploy process super easyâ€” see [package.json](package.json) for a list of commands. 

This Repl comes pre-bundled with everything you need to deploy the exact same app. Just head over to the "Deployments" tab to get started.
